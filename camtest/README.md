#  

things we could do:
make enemies that move
- v hard
- i gave up 5 times

design more levels
- v hard
- no creativity i keep modifying the same level plan so they all kind of look the same

modularise code:
- v hard
- i'm disorganised

#  

i like the idea of modularising 

also things we could do (very ambitious)
- moving platforms
- powerups / items in general
- menu / UI in general
- npcs??????
- add player attack (as opposed to just jumping on enemies)
- puzzle mechanisms (like find a switch to open a door to move on)
- different physics tiles (like water or slippery ice)
